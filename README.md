# Corridor Display System Countdown
A weekly countdown that increments the current week depending on comparisons between current date and next monday parameters, with aspects of its display drawn from Lincoln College's API urls.

NOTE:
To test the JavaScript functions, simply change the "academYr1.getDate" or "academYr2.getDate" to "todaysDate.getDate" and this will be interpreted as the start of the countdown.
